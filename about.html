<h1> About </h1>
<body>
    <div class = "big-box">
<p>
    I am a spatial data scientist and urban planner interested in a range of topics including disaster modelling and prepardness, differences within and between cities, and studying how cities shape experiences. 
</p>

<p>
    I have a background in psychology, with a long history of survey design and analysis. I also completed a Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics from Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy (TMU). Following this degree, I completed a Master of Spatial Analysis at TMU, where my thesis explore spatial methodologies to identify high risk areas of older adults and more extreme heat waves.

<p>
    I am currently completing a Master of Science in Urban Planning at Columbia University. Most of my research is concerned with how planners can best prepare communities for more extreme disasters. More broadly, I am also interested in how urban planning can be more engaging and regain community trust, as well as seeing real change move foward.
