      What should come first, houses or museums? Everything at once: the houses,
      the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban planning cannot ignore
      cultural issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Museum? What is a museum? In everyday life, when we want to describe a person,
      thing or idea that is outdated or useless, we often say “they belong in a museum.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The modern museum has to be a didactic museum, able to marry conservation with
      the message that it is the art that must be highlighted.
