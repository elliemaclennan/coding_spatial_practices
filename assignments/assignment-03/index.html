          What should come first, houses or museums? Everything at once: the houses,
          the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban planning cannot ignore
          cultural issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          The modern museum has to be a didactic museum, able to marry conservation
          with the message that it is the art that must be highlighted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only by satisfying these didactic needs can the museum occupy a vital
          place and be built at the same time as the houses.
