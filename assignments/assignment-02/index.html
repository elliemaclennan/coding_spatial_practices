        What should come first, houses or museums? Everything at once: the houses,
        the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban Planning cannot ignore cultural
        issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Museum? What is a museum? In everyday life, when we want to describe a person,
        thing or idea that is outdated, not practical or useful, we often say “they
        belong in a museum.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The modern museum has to be a didactic museum, able to marry conservation with
        the message that it is the art that must be highlighted, while everything else
        has a far more modest role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evidently written texts, brief and succinct, accompanied by photographs – in a
        sort of cinematographic commentary – are essential if the museum is to occupy
        a vital place.
